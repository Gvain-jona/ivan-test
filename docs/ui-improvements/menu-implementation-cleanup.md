# Menu Implementation Cleanup

This document outlines the cleanup of the menu implementation in the Ivan Prints Business Management System.

## Overview

After consolidating the menu implementation to use ContextMenu.tsx exclusively, we performed a cleanup to remove unused files and code:

1. **Removed ProfileMenu.tsx**: The profile menu functionality is now handled in ContextMenu.tsx
2. **Removed custom-sheet.tsx**: This component was no longer needed for the contextual menu
3. **Cleaned up globals.css**: Removed unused CSS classes related to the custom sheet

## Files Removed

### 1. ProfileMenu.tsx

The ProfileMenu.tsx file was removed because:
- Its functionality has been consolidated into ContextMenu.tsx
- It used a different UI approach (Sheet) than what we standardized on (DropdownMenu)
- Having multiple implementations for similar functionality created inconsistency

### 2. custom-sheet.tsx

The custom-sheet.tsx file was removed because:
- It was created specifically for the contextual menu implementation
- After a thorough search of the codebase, we found no other components using it
- The DropdownMenu component from shadcn/ui provides a better solution for our needs

## Code Cleanup

### 1. Removed CSS Classes

Removed the following CSS class from globals.css:

```css
/* Prevent default sheet animations */
.custom-sheet-content {
  animation: none !important;
  transition: none !important;
}
```

This class was only used with the custom sheet component and is no longer needed.

## Benefits of Cleanup

1. **Reduced Bundle Size**: Removing unused components reduces the overall bundle size
2. **Simplified Codebase**: Fewer files and components make the codebase easier to understand
3. **Improved Maintainability**: Standardizing on a single implementation makes maintenance easier
4. **Cleaner CSS**: Removing unused CSS classes keeps the stylesheet clean and focused

## Future Considerations

If sheet-based modals are needed in the future, we recommend:

1. Using the standard Sheet component from shadcn/ui
2. Creating a new custom component if specific behavior is required
3. Documenting the component's purpose and usage to prevent future duplication
