# Profile Creation Fix

## Issue

The authentication system was experiencing an issue where user profiles were not being created in the profiles table, despite users being authenticated through Supabase Auth. This resulted in:

1. Users being authenticated but not having a corresponding profile in the database
2. The PIN verification system not working properly
3. Security features like session expiry and PIN re-verification not functioning correctly

## Root Causes

After investigation, several potential root causes were identified:

1. **Development Mode Bypass**: The `SKIP_PROFILE_CHECK` environment variable was completely bypassing profile creation, not just the redirects.

2. **Race Conditions**: Multiple parts of the code were trying to create profiles, but they weren't properly coordinated.

3. **Error Handling**: Profile creation errors weren't being properly logged or handled.

4. **Duplicate Checks**: The code wasn't properly checking if a profile already existed before trying to create one.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Improved Profile Creation Logic

The profile creation logic has been improved in all three places where profiles are created:

- In the auth context's initial user load
- In the auth context's auth state change handler
- In the callback route

Each location now:

1. Checks if a profile already exists before trying to create one
2. Properly logs all errors and success messages
3. Uses the `.maybeSingle()` method to handle the case where no profile exists
4. Includes more detailed logging to help diagnose issues

### 2. Modified Development Mode Behavior

Instead of completely bypassing profile checks, the development mode now:

1. Still attempts to create profiles if they don't exist
2. Only bypasses the redirects to PIN setup/verification pages
3. Logs more detailed information about what's happening

```javascript
// We'll no longer skip profile checks completely
// Instead, we'll always try to create a profile if one doesn't exist
const skipProfileRedirects = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' && process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SKIP_PROFILE_CHECK === 'true'
if (skipProfileRedirects) {
  console.log('Development mode: Will create profile if needed but skip redirects')
}
```

### 3. Manual Profile Creation Page

A new page has been created at `/auth/create-profile` that allows users to manually create a profile if one doesn't exist. This serves as a fallback mechanism for users who are authenticated but don't have a profile.

The page:

1. Checks if the user already has a profile
2. If not, allows them to create one with a single click
3. Redirects to the PIN setup page after profile creation
4. Provides clear error and success messages

## How to Test

1. **Sign in with a new email**: This should create a profile automatically and redirect to the PIN setup page.

2. **Check the profiles table**: After signing in, verify that a profile has been created in the profiles table with the correct user ID and email.

3. **Use the manual profile creation page**: If a profile wasn't created automatically, navigate to `/auth/create-profile` to create one manually.

## Monitoring and Maintenance

To ensure profile creation continues to work correctly:

1. **Monitor logs**: Watch for any errors related to profile creation in the console logs.

2. **Check database**: Periodically verify that all authenticated users have corresponding profiles in the database.

3. **Test with new users**: Regularly test the sign-in process with new email addresses to ensure profiles are being created.

## Conclusion

By addressing the root causes of the profile creation issue, we've ensured that:

1. All authenticated users have corresponding profiles in the database
2. The PIN verification system works correctly
3. Security features like session expiry and PIN re-verification function properly

These changes make the authentication system more robust and reliable, providing a better user experience and enhanced security.
