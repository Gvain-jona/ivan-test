# Profile Page Implementation Guide

## Overview
The Profile Page provides a simple interface for users to view their basic information and potentially change their password. It's often closely related to or part of the Settings page but can exist separately for quick access.

## Layout Structure
- **Header**: Page Title ("My Profile").
- **Content Area**: Displays user information and password change form.
  - **User Information Section**: Displays non-editable profile details.
  - **Change Password Section**: Contains the form for updating the password.

## Role-Based Access
- **All Roles (Admin, Manager, Employee)**: All users can access their own Profile Page.
  - View their own Name and Email.
  - Ability to change their own password.

## Detailed Section Specifications

### User Information Section
- **Fields (Read-Only)**:
  - Name
  - Email
  - Role (e.g., "Admin", "Manager", "Employee")
- **Note**: These fields are typically managed by an Admin via the User Management section in Settings.

### Change Password Section
- **Fields**:
  - Current Password (Password Input, Required)
  - New Password (Password Input, Required)
  - Confirm New Password (Password Input, Required)
- **Requirements Displayed**: (e.g., Minimum 8 characters, include numbers and symbols).
- **Actions**: "Update Password" button.

## Form Handling
- **Saving**: The "Update Password" button submits the form.
- **Feedback**: Toast notifications for success ("Password updated successfully") or failure ("Incorrect current password", "Passwords do not match", "Password does not meet requirements").
- **Validation**:
  - All fields required.
  - New Password and Confirm New Password must match.
  - New Password must meet complexity requirements.
  - Server-side validation to check if the Current Password is correct.

## Loading States
- **Initial Page Load**: Minimal loading, possibly a slight delay or simple skeleton for sections.
- **Password Update**: Loading indicator on the "Update Password" button during submission.

## Error Handling
- **Toast Messages**: As described in Form Handling for success/failure scenarios.
- **Inline Form Errors**: For client-side validation issues (e.g., passwords don't match, fields empty, complexity rules not met).

## Mobile Adaptations
- **Layout**: Single-column, sections stack vertically.
- **Forms**: Inputs take full width.

## Implementation Notes
1.  **Security**: Implement secure password hashing and verification on the server-side. Never store passwords in plain text.
2.  **Re-authentication**: Consider requiring users to re-enter their password before accessing sensitive settings or performing critical actions (though changing the password itself often serves this purpose).
3.  **Integration with Settings**: If combined with the Settings page, this becomes a specific section within the Settings navigation.
