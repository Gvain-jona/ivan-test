# Authentication System Cleanup Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to clean up the old authentication system and implement a fully Supabase OTP-based login without PIN verification.

## 1. Database Changes

### 1.1 Migration File Created

Created a new migration file `supabase/migrations/20250920000000_remove_pin_verification.sql` that:

- Creates a backup of the current profiles table
- Removes PIN-related columns from the profiles table:
  - `pin`
  - `verification_code`
  - `code_expiry`
  - `is_verified`
  - `failed_attempts`
- Drops PIN-related functions:
  - `hash_pin(TEXT)`
  - `verify_pin(UUID, TEXT)`
  - `reset_user_pin(UUID)`
- Updates the `handle_new_user` function to simplify profile creation
- Creates a function to restore from backup if needed

## 2. Files Removed

### 2.1 PIN Verification Pages

- `app/auth/setup-pin/page.tsx`
- `app/auth/verify-pin/page.tsx`
- `app/auth/forgot-pin/page.tsx`

### 2.2 Auth Services

- `app/services/auth-service.ts`
- `app/services/session-service.ts`

### 2.3 API Routes

- `app/api/auth/check-pin-verified/route.ts`
- `app/api/auth/check-session/route.ts`

### 2.4 Other Files

- `app/context/auth-provider-v2.tsx`

## 3. Files Updated

### 3.1 Auth Context

Updated `app/context/auth-context.tsx` to:

- Remove PIN-related functions and state
- Simplify the authentication flow
- Focus on standard Supabase Auth with OTP

### 3.2 Auth Callback

Updated `app/auth/callback/route.ts` to:

- Remove PIN-related checks
- Redirect directly to the dashboard after authentication

### 3.3 Middleware

Updated `middleware.ts` to:

- Simplify authentication checks
- Define public routes more explicitly
- Redirect unauthenticated users to the signin page

### 3.4 Root Page

Updated `app/page.tsx` to:

- Redirect to the dashboard if authenticated
- Redirect to the signin page if not authenticated

### 3.5 Signin Page

Updated `app/auth/signin/page.tsx` to:

- Simplify the sign-in process
- Update text to mention OTP instead of magic link
- Improve error handling

### 3.6 Database Schema

Updated `app/lib/validation/database-schemas.ts` to:

- Remove PIN-related fields from the profile schema

### 3.7 Cookies Utility

Updated `app/lib/utils/cookies.ts` to:

- Remove PIN-related cookie functions
- Rename PIN-related cookie names

### 3.8 Admin Utility

Updated `app/lib/supabase/admin.ts` to:

- Remove PIN parameter from the `initializeAdminUser` function

## 4. Current Authentication Flow

The new authentication flow is:

1. User enters email on the sign-in page
2. User receives an OTP via email
3. User enters the OTP to authenticate
4. User is redirected to the dashboard

## 5. Benefits of the New System

1. **Simplicity**: The authentication system is now simpler and more maintainable
2. **Security**: The system uses Supabase's secure authentication system
3. **User Experience**: The authentication flow is more straightforward
4. **Maintainability**: The codebase is cleaner and easier to understand

## 6. Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Test the authentication flow end-to-end
2. **Documentation**: Update documentation to reflect the new authentication system
3. **User Training**: Inform users about the new authentication flow
