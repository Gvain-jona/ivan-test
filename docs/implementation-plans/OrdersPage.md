# Implementation Plan: OrdersPage.tsx Refactoring

This document outlines the detailed step-by-step plan for refactoring the `app/dashboard/orders/page.tsx` component to adhere to the 200-line file size limit while improving code organization, maintainability, and reusability.

## Current Component Analysis

**File Path:** `app/dashboard/orders/page.tsx`

**Current Structure:**
- Large page component with multiple sections (header, metrics, tabs for orders and tasks)
- Complex state management for orders, tasks, filters, and pagination
- Multiple utility functions and handlers for various operations
- Sample data stored directly in the component file
- Exceeds 760 lines

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Separate sample data from component
- Extract metric cards into a separate component
- Extract tab content components
- Extract modal management
- Create custom hooks for state management
- Create context for state sharing

## Refactoring Goals

1. Break down the component into smaller, focused components
2. Extract business logic into custom hooks
3. Move sample data to separate files
4. Implement context provider for state sharing
5. Maintain all current functionality
6. Ensure the main component file is under 200 lines

## File Structure After Refactoring

```
app/
└── dashboard/
    └── orders/
        ├── page.tsx                      # Main page component (<200 lines)
        ├── _components/                  # Local components
        │   ├── OrdersPageHeader.tsx      # Page header component
        │   ├── OrderMetricsCards.tsx     # Metrics cards grid
        │   ├── OrdersTab.tsx             # Orders tab content
        │   └── TasksTab.tsx              # Tasks tab content
        ├── _hooks/                       # Local hooks

        │   ├── useOrdersPagination.ts    # Pagination hook
        │   └── useOrderModals.ts         # Modal state management hook
        ├── _context/                     # Local context
        │   └── OrdersPageContext.tsx     # Context for state sharing
        └── _data/                        # Local data
            ├── sample-orders.tsx         # Sample order data
            └── sample-tasks.tsx          # Sample task data
```

## Detailed Refactoring Steps

### Step 1: Extract Sample Data to Separate Files

1. Create data directory and files
   ```
   mkdir -p app/dashboard/orders/_data
   ```

2. Create sample orders data file
   ```
   touch app/dashboard/orders/_data/sample-orders.ts
   ```

3. Create sample tasks data file
   ```
   touch app/dashboard/orders/_data/sample-tasks.ts
   ```

4. Move sample data to the respective files

### Step 2: Create Custom Hooks

1. Create hooks directory
   ```
   mkdir -p app/dashboard/orders/_hooks
   ```

2. Create the hooks files
   ```
   touch app/dashboard/orders/_hooks/useOrdersPageState.ts
   touch app/dashboard/orders/_hooks/useOrderFiltering.ts
   touch app/dashboard/orders/_hooks/useOrdersPagination.ts
   touch app/dashboard/orders/_hooks/useOrderModals.ts
   ```

3. Implement the hooks with the extracted logic

### Step 3: Create Context Provider

1. Create context directory
   ```
   mkdir -p app/dashboard/orders/_context
   ```

2. Create context file
   ```
   touch app/dashboard/orders/_context/OrdersPageContext.tsx
   ```

3. Implement context with the extracted state and logic

### Step 4: Create Subcomponents

1. Create components directory
   ```
   mkdir -p app/dashboard/orders/_components
   ```

2. Create the component files
   ```
   touch app/dashboard/orders/_components/OrdersPageHeader.tsx
   touch app/dashboard/orders/_components/OrderMetricsCards.tsx
   touch app/dashboard/orders/_components/OrdersTab.tsx
   touch app/dashboard/orders/_components/TasksTab.tsx
   ```

3. Implement each component with its specific functionality

### Step 5: Refactor the Main Page Component

1. Update the main page component to use the new structure
2. Implement the context provider pattern
3. Ensure all functionality is preserved

## Implementation Steps

We'll implement this refactoring step by step, documenting each change:

### Phase 1: Extract Data (Day 1)
- Extract sample orders data to separate file
- Extract sample tasks data to separate file
- Update imports in the main component

### Phase 2: Create Custom Hooks (Day 2)
- Implement useOrdersPageState hook
- Implement useOrderFiltering hook
- Implement useOrdersPagination hook
- Implement useOrderModals hook

### Phase 3: Create Context Provider (Day 3)
- Implement OrdersPageContext
- Create provider component
- Define context interfaces and types

### Phase 4: Create Components (Day 4-5)
- Implement OrdersPageHeader component
- Implement OrderMetricsCards component
- Implement OrdersTab component
- Implement TasksTab component

### Phase 5: Refactor Main Component (Day 6)

- Integrate with context provider
- Ensure all functionality works as expected

### Phase 6: Testing and Final Cleanup (Day 7)
- Test full functionality
- Check for any issues or bugs
- Final code review and cleanup

## Benefits of Refactoring

1. **Improved Maintainability:** Each component and hook has a clear, single responsibility
2. **Enhanced Reusability:** Hooks and components can be reused in other parts of the application
3. **Better Testability:** Smaller components and isolated logic are easier to test
4. **Reduced Cognitive Load:** Developers can focus on smaller pieces of logic
5. **Improved Performance:** Potential for more granular re-renders due to better component structure
6. **Code Organization:** Clear separation of concerns with dedicated directories
7. **File Size Compliance:** Main component file will be under 200 lines
