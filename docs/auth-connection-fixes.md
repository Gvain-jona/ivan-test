# Authentication Connection Fixes

## Overview

This document summarizes the fixes made to address connection issues in the authentication system. The main focus was on improving the health check mechanism and preventing multiple Supabase client instances.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Non-existent RPC Function

The code was trying to call a function named `version` in Supabase, but that function doesn't exist. This was causing 404 errors when trying to check the connection to Supabase.

### 2. Multiple GoTrueClient Instances

The warning "Multiple GoTrueClient instances detected in the same browser context" was appearing in the console. This was happening because we were creating multiple Supabase clients, which can lead to undefined behavior.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Improved Health Check

- Replaced the call to the non-existent `version` RPC function with a simple query to check if we can connect to Supabase
- Added better error handling for the health check
- Added try-catch blocks to handle exceptions during the health check
- Ignored "no rows returned" errors during the health check, as they don't indicate a connection issue

### 2. Singleton Pattern for Supabase Client

- Implemented a singleton pattern for the client-side Supabase client to prevent multiple instances
- Added a check to return the existing instance if one already exists
- Kept the server-side client as a factory function, as each request needs its own instance due to potential cookie handling differences

## Benefits of the Fixes

1. **Reliability**: The health check now works reliably without 404 errors
2. **Performance**: Using a singleton pattern for the client-side Supabase client reduces resource usage
3. **Stability**: Preventing multiple GoTrueClient instances avoids potential undefined behavior
4. **Better Debugging**: Improved error handling makes it easier to diagnose issues

## Code Changes

### Client-Side Supabase Client

```typescript
import { createClient as createSupabaseClient, SupabaseClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'

// Singleton instance
let supabaseInstance: SupabaseClient | null = null

/**
 * Creates a Supabase client for database operations
 * Uses a singleton pattern to prevent multiple instances
 */
export function createClient() {
  if (supabaseInstance) {
    return supabaseInstance
  }
  
  supabaseInstance = createSupabaseClient(
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!
  )
  
  return supabaseInstance
}
```

### Health Check

```typescript
// First check if we can connect to Supabase
try {
  // Use a simple query to check if we can connect to Supabase
  const { error: healthError } = await supabase
    .from('profiles')
    .select('count')
    .limit(1)
    .maybeSingle()
  
  if (healthError && healthError.code !== 'PGRST116') { // Ignore 'no rows returned' error
    console.error('Error connecting to Supabase:', healthError)
    // If we can't connect to Supabase, we'll just continue without a profile
    setIsLoading(false)
    return
  }
} catch (healthError) {
  console.error('Exception connecting to Supabase:', healthError)
  // If we can't connect to Supabase, we'll just continue without a profile
  setIsLoading(false)
  return
}
```

## Conclusion

By addressing the connection issues in the authentication system, we've created a more reliable and stable system. The improved health check mechanism and singleton pattern for the Supabase client ensure that the authentication flow works correctly without errors or warnings.
