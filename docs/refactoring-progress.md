## Notes:

- All utility functions, UI components, and hooks have been created with proper TypeScript types and JSDoc documentation.
- The badge components are designed to be reusable across the application, with appropriate styling for different statuses.
- The table components support sorting and pagination, which should work with the existing data structures.
- The form components will help create a consistent layout for all forms in the application.
- The custom hooks provide reusable logic for common patterns in the application, reducing code duplication.
