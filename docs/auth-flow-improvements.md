# Authentication Flow Improvements

## Overview

This document summarizes the improvements made to the authentication flow to prevent auth loops, ensure correct redirects, and improve the magic link behavior.

## Supabase Configuration Requirements

To ensure the authentication system works correctly, the following configurations should be made in Supabase:

1. **Enable Email Authentication**:
   - Go to Authentication > Providers
   - Make sure Email provider is enabled
   - Enable "Confirm email" option for magic links

2. **Set Up Email Templates**:
   - Go to Authentication > Email Templates
   - Customize the "Magic Link" template to match your branding
   - Make sure the email content clearly explains the authentication process

3. **Configure Site URL**:
   - Go to Authentication > URL Configuration
   - Set the Site URL to your production URL (e.g., https://your-domain.com)
   - Add any additional redirect URLs if needed

4. **Database Functions**:
   - Ensure the following functions exist:
     - `is_email_allowed`: Checks if an email is in the allowed_emails table
     - `hash_pin`: Hashes a PIN using bcrypt
     - `verify_pin`: Verifies a PIN against the stored hash

5. **Database Tables**:
   - Ensure the `profiles` table has the necessary columns:
     - `pin`: For storing the hashed PIN
     - `is_verified`: Boolean to track if the user has set up a PIN
     - `failed_attempts`: Integer to track failed PIN verification attempts

## Improvements Made

### 1. Preventing Auth Loops

The middleware has been updated to prevent authentication loops:

- If a user is already authenticated and has verified their PIN, they are redirected to the dashboard when trying to access auth pages
- If a user is authenticated but hasn't verified their PIN, they are redirected to the appropriate PIN page
- The callback route is always accessible to process magic links

### 2. Intelligent Redirects

The callback route has been updated to handle redirects more intelligently:

- After processing a magic link, the system checks if the user has a PIN set up
- If they have a PIN, they are redirected to the PIN verification page
- If they don't have a PIN, they are redirected to the PIN setup page
- If there's an error, they are redirected to the sign-in page with an error message

### 3. Improved Magic Link Behavior

The magic link behavior has been improved:

- The magic link now includes a `next` parameter to preserve the intended destination
- The callback route uses a 303 redirect to ensure the browser uses GET for the redirect
- This helps prevent the browser from resubmitting the form when using the back button

### 4. Better Error Handling

Error handling has been improved throughout the authentication flow:

- The callback route now handles errors when exchanging the code for a session
- The auth context has been updated to handle errors when checking if an email is allowed
- The middleware provides better error messages when redirecting users

## Complete Authentication Flow

The improved authentication flow now works as follows:

1. **Sign-in Page**:
   - User enters their email
   - System checks if the email is allowed
   - If allowed, a magic link is sent to the email with a `next` parameter

2. **Magic Link Processing**:
   - User clicks the magic link in their email
   - System exchanges the code for a session
   - System checks if the user has a PIN set up
   - User is redirected to the appropriate PIN page

3. **PIN Management**:
   - If first-time user: User sets up a PIN on the setup-pin page
   - If returning user: User verifies their PIN on the verify-pin page

4. **Dashboard Access**:
   - After successful PIN verification, user is redirected to their intended destination
   - PIN verification status is stored in a cookie to prevent repeated verification

## Conclusion

These improvements create a more robust and user-friendly authentication flow that prevents auth loops, ensures correct redirects, and improves the magic link behavior. The changes ensure that users are always directed to the appropriate page based on their authentication status and PIN setup status.
