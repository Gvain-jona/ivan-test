# Authentication Logout Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of the logout functionality in the profile contextual menu of the Ivan Prints Business Management System.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Accessing the Auth Context

The logout functionality is implemented by accessing the `signOut` function from the auth context in the ContextMenu component:

```javascript
import { useAuth } from '@/app/context/auth-context';

// Inside the component
const { signOut } = useAuth();
```

### 2. Adding the Logout Button

The logout button is added to the profile contextual menu with an onClick handler that calls the signOut function:

```javascript
<button 
  className="flex items-center w-full px-2 py-1.5 text-sm rounded-md hover:bg-muted text-destructive transition-colors"
  onClick={signOut}
>
  <LogOut className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />
  <span>Logout</span>
</button>
```

### 3. The signOut Function

The signOut function in the auth context performs the following actions:

```javascript
const signOut = async () => {
  try {
    // Clear PIN verification cookie
    document.cookie = 'pin_verified=; Max-Age=0; path=/; secure; samesite=lax'
    
    // Clear PIN verification timestamp from localStorage
    localStorage.removeItem('pin_verified_at')

    // Sign out from Supabase
    await supabase.auth.signOut()

    // Redirect to sign in page
    router.push('/auth/signin')
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error signing out:', error)
  }
}
```

This function:
1. Clears the PIN verification cookie
2. Clears the PIN verification timestamp from localStorage
3. Signs out from Supabase using the auth API
4. Redirects the user to the sign-in page

## User Experience

When a user clicks the "Logout" button in the profile contextual menu:

1. The user is immediately signed out
2. All authentication cookies and localStorage items are cleared
3. The user is redirected to the sign-in page
4. The user will need to sign in again and verify their PIN to access the application

## Security Considerations

The logout functionality enhances security by:

1. Clearing all authentication tokens from the browser
2. Clearing the PIN verification status
3. Requiring the user to sign in again and verify their PIN
4. Preventing unauthorized access if the user leaves their device unattended

## Testing

To test the logout functionality:

1. Sign in to the application
2. Navigate to any page
3. Click the profile icon in the footer navigation
4. Click the "Logout" button in the contextual menu
5. Verify that you are redirected to the sign-in page
6. Try to access a protected page (e.g., /dashboard/orders)
7. Verify that you are redirected to the sign-in page

## Conclusion

The logout functionality is a critical part of the authentication system, allowing users to securely end their sessions. By implementing this functionality in the profile contextual menu, we've made it easily accessible while maintaining security.
