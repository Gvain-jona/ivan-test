# Supabase Migration Audit Report

## Overview

This report documents the audit and consolidation of the Supabase migrations and seed files for the Ivan Prints Business Management System. The goal was to clean up and standardize the database structure, ensuring it aligns with the frontend requirements.

## Issues Identified

1. **Inconsistent Schema Definitions**: Multiple migration files defined the same tables with different structures, leading to confusion and potential errors.

2. **Mismatches Between Frontend and Database**: The frontend order forms collected data that didn't match the database schema (e.g., `client_type`, `size` in order items).

3. **Auth System Evolution**: The auth system evolved from a custom implementation to using Supabase Auth with profiles, but the migration files didn't clearly reflect this evolution.

4. **Seed File Issues**: The seed file referenced tables that don't exist or have incorrect column names.

5. **Multiple Migration Approaches**: There were migrations in both `supabase/migrations` and `app/lib/supabase/migrations`.

## Actions Taken

### 1. Consolidated Orders Schema

Created a consolidated migration file (`20250600000000_consolidated_orders_schema.sql`) that:

- Defines the `orders` table with all required fields, including `client_type`
- Defines the `order_items` table with all required fields, including `size`
- Defines the `order_payments` table with consistent field names
- Includes triggers for maintaining data integrity
- Adds appropriate indexes for performance
- Includes detailed comments for documentation

### 2. Consolidated Auth Schema

Created a consolidated migration file (`20250600000001_consolidated_auth_schema.sql`) that:

- Defines the `profiles` table that extends Supabase Auth users
- Defines the `auth_sessions` table for tracking custom session data
- Includes RPC functions for email verification and PIN verification
- Sets up Row Level Security policies
- Adds appropriate indexes for performance
- Includes detailed comments for documentation

### 3. Updated Seed File

Created a consolidated seed file (`seed.sql`) that:

- Works with the consolidated schema
- Fixes references to non-existent tables
- Fixes column name mismatches
- Ensures proper data is seeded for testing
- Includes a larger dataset to better mimic real-life scenarios

### 4. Archived Outdated Files

Moved outdated migration files to an archive directory (`supabase/migrations/archive`) and documented the archiving process.

### 5. Created Documentation

- Created a README file for the consolidated schema (`README-consolidated.md`)
- Created a README file for the archived files (`migrations/archive/README.md`)
- Created this audit report

## Schema Changes

### Orders Table Changes

- Added `client_type` field to distinguish between regular and contract clients
- Updated `status` check constraint to include all required statuses
- Changed `balance` to be a computed column based on total_amount and amount_paid
- Added `payment_method` field for tracking the primary payment method
- Added `notes` JSONB field for storing order notes

### Order Items Table Changes

- Added `size` field to track item sizes
- Added denormalized `item_name` and `category_name` fields for performance
- Changed `total_amount` to be a computed column based on quantity and unit_price
- Added `profit_amount` and `labor_amount` fields for financial tracking

### Order Payments Table Changes

- Renamed `payment_type` to `payment_method` for consistency
- Removed `notes` field as it's not needed
- Updated payment method options to match frontend requirements

### Auth System Changes

- Consolidated to use Supabase Auth with the `profiles` table
- Added PIN-based authentication
- Added email verification with verification codes
- Added device tracking for multi-device support

## Recommendations

1. **Use the Consolidated Files**: All new development should use the consolidated migration and seed files.

2. **Update Frontend Code**: Ensure the frontend code is updated to work with the consolidated schema.

3. **Implement Database Tests**: Create tests to verify the database schema matches the frontend requirements.

4. **Document Schema Changes**: Keep this documentation updated as the schema evolves.

5. **Regular Audits**: Perform regular audits of the database schema to ensure it remains aligned with the frontend requirements.

## Applying the Changes

To apply these changes, follow these steps:

1. Run the consolidated migration files:
   ```bash
   npx supabase db reset
   ```

2. Seed the database with the updated seed file:
   ```bash
   .\run-seed-sql.ps1
   ```

## Conclusion

The consolidation of the Supabase migrations and seed files has resulted in a cleaner, more consistent database schema that better aligns with the frontend requirements. The consolidated files provide a solid foundation for future development.
