# Supabase Auth Migration

This directory contains the migration file for the new Supabase-based authentication system.

## Migration File

- `20250800000000_supabase_auth_migration.sql`: New consolidated schema for the Supabase-based authentication system

## Changes from Previous Auth System

The new authentication system makes the following changes:

1. **Removes Custom Extensions**:
   - Removed PIN-based authentication
   - Removed custom email verification with verification codes
   - Removed device tracking and management
   - Removed custom session management for PIN re-entry

2. **Simplifies the Profiles Table**:
   - Keeps only the fields needed for role-based access control
   - Links directly to Supabase Auth users

3. **Improves RLS Policies**:
   - Fixes potential infinite recursion issues
   - Optimizes policy performance
   - Ensures proper security

## Authentication Flow

The new authentication flow uses standard Supabase Auth methods:

1. **Sign Up**: Users sign up using Supabase Auth's built-in methods
2. **Email Verification**: Email verification is handled by Supabase Auth
3. **Sign In**: Users sign in using Supabase Auth's built-in methods
4. **Session Management**: Session management is handled by Supabase Auth
5. **Role-Based Access**: Role-based access control is still implemented using the profiles table

## Frontend Changes Required

The frontend code will need to be updated to:

1. Remove references to PIN entry and verification code entry
2. Use standard Supabase Auth methods for authentication
3. Update the auth service to remove custom extensions
4. Update any components that rely on the custom authentication flow

## Migration Process

The migration process involved:

1. Analyzing the existing authentication system
2. Identifying unnecessary custom extensions
3. Creating a new consolidated migration file
4. Archiving old migration files
5. Documenting the changes
